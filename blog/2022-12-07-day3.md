Today was very useful for me, coming out of a Bootcamp environment. While I think bootcamp is effective for demonstrating that you can learn a lot of things, and apply them very quickly, it certainly left a lot of holes, and part of code in the first project I was assigned to at Progressive might as well have been hieroglyphics. I’ll be interested to go back and look at that code after today, as I think some of the concepts will make a lot of things click.
For one, it explains why many things are broken up the way they are, but the thing I was most excited to learn today was actually the ‘simple’ syntax of using “?” and “:”s in lieu of ifs and elses, and using methods, like Select(), instead of a loop. I’ve been thoroughly confused by some challenges that say, “try to solve this in one line of code.” I’ll actually be going back to some of the old challenges I’ve done on the site Codesignal to see how much more efficiently I can solve the problems now that I understand how to implement this.
