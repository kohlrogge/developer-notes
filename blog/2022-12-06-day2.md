Today I learned some useful C# syntax. I previously did not know about using @ at the beginning of string to make it a verbatim sting, and have had issues with this in the past when using quotes or slashes. 

One of the other things that I found very useful was using ctrl + . to create a new type and easily put a new class in another project with the appropriate dependencies. 

I also learned the difference between the stack and the heap (value defined by struct vs value defined by a class).

I continued to gain insight into ways to unit test, and learned for the first time how to test for a thrown exception. 

Today was a really good refresher for some basic principles, including encapsulation. While I've done things similar to this app before - working with bank accounts, and using and testing methods for withdrawing and depositing- it has been awhile and I've been getting rusty while trying to learn other things, so I'm happy to be revisiting some old concepts while filling in the holes in the foundation and learning new things.
