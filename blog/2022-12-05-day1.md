What I Learned Today:
- CLR is software that runs the application and is necessary for most .net applications.
- IL is intermediate code created at the time of compilation
- The entry point for a .net application if the starting point the application. 

What do I need to learn more about?
 - The syntax used in creating the API was somewhat confusing at times. I'm not sure I'd be able to explaint he function of each line of code used in the application. I need to continue to get more familiar with C# and the structuring of the code in general.
